# Project 4 - Group 3 - Predicting Home Prices in Texas

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze and predict how housing prices will change over the years. This will help one decide where to relocate in the long term. 

We chose to narrow our location to the state of Texas, as it has been a popular spot where people have been migrating due to the affordability of home prices along with the nice hot weather.

Objectives:
1. Generate project-specific questions.
2. Obtain relevant datasets
3. Utilize Jupyter Notebook for data import and cleaning
4. Implement SQL to create our database
5. Deploy AWS to grant everyone access to the database
6. Apply machine learning techniques such as linear regression and random forest.
7. Utilize Tableau to create an informative visual dashboard.
8. Develop our presentation using Microsoft Powerpoint.
